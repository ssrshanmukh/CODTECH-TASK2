OVER VIEW OF FINITE STATE MACHINE:

A finite state machine (FSM) is a computational model used to design algorithms and systems that can be in a finite number of states. It’s widely used in various fields, including computer science, engineering, and linguistics. Here’s an overview of its key components and concepts:

Key Components
States: A finite set of conditions or configurations that the machine can be in at any given time. There are typically one or more initial states and one or more accepting states.

Transitions: Rules that describe how the FSM moves from one state to another based on inputs. Each transition is usually associated with a specific input symbol.

Input Alphabet: A finite set of symbols that the FSM can read. These symbols trigger transitions between states.

Initial State: The state in which the FSM starts processing input.

Accepting States: States that determine if the input is accepted or rejected based on the FSM's design.

Types of Finite State Machines
Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA): Each state has exactly one transition for each symbol in the input alphabet. This means that for any given state and input symbol, the next state is uniquely determined.

Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA): States can have multiple transitions for the same input symbol, or transitions that do not require any input (ε-transitions). This allows for multiple possible next states.

Applications
Lexical Analysis: In compilers, FSMs are used to tokenize input strings.
Protocol Design: FSMs can model communication protocols and stateful systems.
Control Systems: Used in digital circuit design and robotics for controlling states based on inputs.
Game Development: To manage character states and transitions in response to player actions.
Advantages
Simplicity: FSMs provide a clear and simple way to model complex systems.
Predictability: The behavior of FSMs is easy to analyze and understand.
Limitations
State Explosion: Complex systems may require a large number of states, making them hard to manage.
Memory Usage: For very large systems, the memory required can grow significantly.
Overall, finite state machines are a foundational concept in computer science, offering a systematic way to represent and analyze systems with distinct states and transitions.
